To begin, click anywhere on the screen. 5 random strategems will be selected, with the leftmost being highlighted, its name displayed and the proper strategem input order dipslayed as well.

Using the arrow keys, enter the strategem input from left to right. 

Completing a strategem input will move to the next stratgem, repeating the process and earning you 20 points.
